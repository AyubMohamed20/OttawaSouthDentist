- Review your oral hygiene habits
- Take X-rays if necessary to detect hidden issues

**Recommended Frequency:** Every 6 months for most patients

### FAQs

Most patients should visit the dentist every 6 months for a routine checkup and cleaning. However, some patients may need more frequent visits based on their oral health needs.

**What happens during a dental checkup?**
During a checkup, your dentist will examine your teeth and gums, check for cavities, evaluate your bite, and may take X-rays. You'll also receive a professional cleaning.

## 2. Preventive Dentistry

Preventive dentistry focuses on maintaining good oral health to avoid cavities, gum disease, and other dental problems. Services include:

- Professional teeth cleaning
- Fluoride treatments
- Dental sealants
- Oral hygiene education
- Nutritional counseling for dental health
- Custom mouthguards for sports
- Night guards for teeth grinding

### Benefits of Preventive Care

- Reduces the risk of cavities and gum disease
- Catches problems early when they're easier to treat
- Saves money on extensive dental work
- Maintains a healthy, beautiful smile
- Prevents tooth loss

### FAQs

**What are dental sealants?**
Dental sealants are thin protective coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of back teeth to prevent cavities. They're especially beneficial for children but can also help adults.

**How does fluoride protect my teeth?**
Fluoride strengthens tooth enamel and helps repair early stages of tooth decay. Professional fluoride treatments provide a higher concentration than toothpaste.

## 3. Dental Hygiene

Professional dental hygiene services are crucial for maintaining healthy teeth and gums. Our dental hygienists provide:

- Thorough teeth cleaning (prophylaxis)
- Removal of plaque and tartar buildup
- Polishing teeth to remove surface stains
- Gum health assessment
- Personalized oral hygiene instructions
- Deep cleaning (scaling and root planing) when needed

### The Cleaning Process

1. **Assessment** – Examining your teeth and gums
2. **Scaling** – Removing plaque and tartar from tooth surfaces
3. **Polishing** – Smoothing and polishing teeth
4. **Flossing** – Cleaning between teeth
5. **Fluoride Treatment** – Optional protective treatment

### FAQs

**Why is professional cleaning important if I brush and floss?**
Even with excellent home care, plaque can build up in hard-to-reach areas. Professional cleanings remove this buildup and help prevent gum disease.

**What is the difference between regular cleaning and deep cleaning?**
Regular cleaning removes plaque and tartar above the gum line. Deep cleaning (scaling and root planing) treats buildup below the gum line, typically needed for patients with gum disease.

## 4. White Fillings (Composite Fillings)

White fillings, also known as composite fillings, are tooth-colored restorations used to repair teeth damaged by decay or fractures.

### Advantages of White Fillings

- **Natural appearance** – Match the color of your natural teeth
- **Conservative** – Require less removal of healthy tooth structure
- **Bonding** – Chemically bond to the tooth for added strength
- **Mercury-free** – Safe, biocompatible materials
- **Versatile** – Can repair chips, cracks, and gaps

### The Procedure

1. Removal of decay or damaged tooth structure
2. Preparation and conditioning of the tooth
3. Application of bonding agent
4. Placement of composite material in layers
5. Shaping and curing with special light
6. Final polishing and bite adjustment

### FAQs

**How long do white fillings last?**
With proper care, white fillings typically last 5-10 years or longer. Factors like size, location, and oral habits affect longevity.

**Are white fillings as strong as silver fillings?**
Modern composite materials are very durable and suitable for most fillings. For very large restorations, your dentist may recommend other options.

**Can I replace my old silver fillings with white ones?**
Yes, many patients choose to replace amalgam fillings with white fillings for aesthetic reasons or personal preference.

## 5. Root Canal Treatment

Root canal treatment saves teeth that are infected or severely damaged. The procedure removes infected pulp tissue from inside the tooth, relieving pain and preserving the natural tooth.

### When Is Root Canal Needed?

- Severe toothache, especially when chewing
- Prolonged sensitivity to hot or cold
- Darkening of the tooth
- Swelling or tenderness in nearby gums
- Abscess or pimple on the gums

### The Procedure

1. **Diagnosis** – X-rays and examination to assess the infection
2. **Anesthesia** – Numbing the area for comfort
3. **Access** – Creating an opening in the tooth crown
4. **Cleaning** – Removing infected pulp and cleaning the canals
5. **Shaping** – Preparing the canals for filling
6. **Filling** – Sealing the canals with biocompatible material
7. **Restoration** – Placing a crown to protect the tooth

### FAQs

**Is root canal treatment painful?**
Modern root canal treatment is performed with effective anesthesia and is generally no more uncomfortable than getting a filling. Most patients report relief from the pain caused by the infection.

**What happens if I don't get a root canal?**
Without treatment, the infection can spread, causing an abscess, bone loss, and potentially requiring tooth extraction.

**How successful is root canal treatment?**
Root canal treatment has a high success rate (over 95%) and teeth can last a lifetime with proper care.

## 7. Dental Implants

Dental implants are the gold standard for replacing missing teeth. They provide a permanent, natural-looking solution that functions like real teeth.

### What Are Dental Implants?

A dental implant consists of three parts:
1. **Implant post** – A titanium screw placed in the jawbone
2. **Abutment** – A connector piece
3. **Crown** – The visible tooth restoration

### Benefits of Dental Implants

- **Permanent solution** – Can last a lifetime with proper care
- **Natural appearance and function** – Look and feel like real teeth
- **Preserve bone** – Stimulate the jawbone to prevent bone loss
- **No impact on adjacent teeth** – Unlike bridges, no alteration of neighboring teeth
- **Easy maintenance** – Care for them like natural teeth

### Types of Implants Offered

- Single tooth implants
- Multiple tooth implants
- Implant-supported bridges
- Implant-supported dentures (All-on-4)

### The Implant Process

1. **Consultation** – Assessment and treatment planning
2. **Implant placement** – Surgical placement of the titanium post
3. **Healing period** – 3-6 months for osseointegration (bone fusion)
4. **Abutment placement** – Attaching the connector
5. **Crown placement** – Final restoration

### FAQs

**Am I a candidate for dental implants?**
Most adults with good general health are candidates. Adequate jawbone density is needed, though bone grafting can help those with bone loss.

**How long do dental implants last?**
With proper care, dental implants can last a lifetime. The crown may need replacement after 10-15 years.

**Is the implant procedure painful?**
The procedure is performed under local anesthesia. Most patients report less discomfort than expected and manage well with over-the-counter pain medication.
